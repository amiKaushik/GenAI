# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**. Customer churn refers to whether a customer is likely to **leave** or **stay** with a company. The model is trained on a churn dataset and deployed with an interactive **Streamlit** web application for visualization and real-time prediction.

The goal of this project is to help businesses identify at-risk customers early and take proactive retention actions.

## 🧠 Project Structure

The project is divided into **three main components**:

### 1️⃣ Model Training

* Preprocessing of the churn dataset (handling categorical variables, scaling, etc.)
* Building an ANN using deep learning techniques
* Training and validating the model to learn customer behavior patterns

### 2️⃣ Model Prediction

* Using the trained ANN model to predict whether a customer will:

  * **Stay with the company**
  * **Leave the company (Churn)**
* Predictions are based on customer input features

### 3️⃣ Streamlit Deployment & Visualization

* Interactive web interface built using Streamlit
* Allows users to input customer details
* Displays churn prediction results in real time
* Simplifies model usage for non-technical users

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning / Deep Learning:**

  * TensorFlow / Keras
  * Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
* **Data Processing:**

  * NumPy
